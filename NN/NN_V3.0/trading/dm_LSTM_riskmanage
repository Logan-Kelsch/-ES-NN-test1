ACCOUNT LEVERAGING:
    Per trading at 60%Winrate,
        11% account value per trade {OPTION 1}
            greatest for 3 standard deviation 50% account value retention
        20% account value per trade {OPTION 2}
            mathematically optimal for maximal gain / minimal loss

if we expect 4 point average
then
    11% -   $181.81 per contract
    20% -   $100.00 per contract !! Too Low!



Need to assess risk management:



DEFINED RISKS:

Lowest low of 15 minute trading window
    up to 20 point drawback at MOST VOLITILE (9:30am-9:45am) ([/MES] - $100)
        -- Accout Value Holds >= $175 per contracts == 28% account
