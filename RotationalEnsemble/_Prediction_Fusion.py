'''
-   Model Stacking and Prediction fusion
-   -   -   This could be done possibly by bagging or stacking methods already created
-   -   -   could also train an LSTM NN or other model on stacked model predictions for one best prediction
-   -   -   'meta-model'? could use linear regression for this or logistic regression
-   -   -   this I guess is called level-0 models vs level-1 model
