Below is a concise way to think about the three Markov-style formalisms and how they fit inside an evolutionary (GA) wrapper when you’re trying to trade a non-stationary, only-partially-observable system such as index-futures.

### 1.  What each model really gives you  

| Model | What’s **hidden**? | Can you **act**? | Meant for **stationary** dynamics? | Typical use in trading |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **HMM** | Market regime (state **and** its transitions) | **No** – it’s a passive generative model | Yes | Regime detection / feature engineering (bull, bear, high-vol, macro-shock, …)citeturn3view0 |
| **MDP** | Nothing – state is fully observed | **Yes** | Yes (fixed transition tensor) | Optimal control *if* the state you feed it already captures the whole market structureciteturn2view0 |
| **HM-MDP** (a special POMDP) | A *mode* variable picks which MDP is currently in force; the mode is hidden and can change stochastically | **Yes** | **No** – explicitly models regime-switching | Designed for exactly the “bull vs. bear vs. crash vs. sideways” case; empirically solves faster than converting to a generic POMDPciteturn7view0 |

**Key intuition:**  
*HMM → tells you **what** the market probably is right now;  
MDP → tells you **what to do** assuming you know everything;  
HM-MDP → merges both: “the market is secretly in one of _k_ regimes; choose actions that maximize reward despite that uncertainty.”*

### 2.  Why an HM-MDP (or any POMDP) is the best theoretical match

1. **Partial observability + non-stationarity**  
   Futures prices, order-book micro-structure, macro releases, etc. only let you *infer* the true underlying regime. HM-MDP makes that latent variable explicit and lets you plan on beliefs rather than raw observations.citeturn7view0  

2. **Action-dependent rewards**  
   Unlike an HMM, an HM-MDP includes actions and reward functions, so it can encode slippage, funding, position size, risk limits, etc.

3. **Lower parameter count than a full POMDP**  
   Because each mode shares the same state & action spaces, the dimensionality of value-function backups is |M| instead of |M| × |S|, giving orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in dynamic-programming updates versus a generic POMDP solver.citeturn7view0

### 3.  Where a Genetic Algorithm actually helps

Even with the HM-MDP abstraction you still face three hard sub-problems:

| Sub-problem | Why it’s hard | How GA can help |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Model discovery** – picking state variables, number of hidden modes, transition priors | Thousands of features ⇒ combinatorial search | Let chromosomes encode “feature subset + number of modes + prior hyper-params” and evolve those that maximize out-of-sample likelihood or Sharpe |
| **Policy optimisation** – mapping belief states ↦ actions | Continuous action values, non-convex objective with transaction costs | Evolve policy representations (e.g., linear weights on beliefs, decision trees, small neural nets) instead of running gradient RL each generation |
| **Risk / meta-parameters** – position sizing, stop logic | Coupled, non-differentiable | Encapsulate them in the chromosome; fitness = risk-adjusted return |

A proven template is to **nest** the RL problem inside the evolutionary loop:

```
for each generation:
    for each individual chromosome:
        1. Build HM-MDP parameters / policy from genes
        2. Run fast back-test simulator (or boot-strapped episodes)
        3. Fitness = f(net_PnL, drawdown, turnover, etc.)
    4. GA operators → next generation
```

Evidence that GA+MDP hybrids are competitive for equities already exists (Chang & Lee 2017). Their GA searched both timing rules and MDP-based allocation decisions and beat baselines on multiple Taiwanese stocks.citeturn5view0

### 4.  Practical roadmap with your “large collection of features”

1. **Pre-phase: Regime-detection HMM**  
   *Why*: faster unsupervised clustering of raw features; gives you an initial guess at |M|.  
   *How*: EM or Bayesian HMM on log-returns + volatility; keep the posterior P(mode = m | obs<sub>t</sub>) as *additional* inputs.

2. **Build the HM-MDP**  
   *State* = [hand-picked micro-features + recent returns bucket + inventory level]  
   *Mode* = latent regime learned above  
   *Actions* = {flat, long 1, short 1, scale ±Δq, …}  
   *Rewards* = PNL − costs − risk_penalty.

3. **Encode genes**  
   - Bit-mask for which of your N features to include.  
   - Integer for |M| (2–6 covers most macro regimes).  
   - Real-valued vectors for transition logits, reward scaling, position size, etc.  
   - Pointers to a small differentiable policy net (architecture, weight seed).

4. **Fitness evaluation**  
   - Walk-forward split (e.g., expanding window) to reduce look-ahead bias.  
   - Reinforce with risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, MAR, order-imbalance cost).  
   - Early-stop individuals that breach max drawdown to save evaluation time.

5. **After GA convergence**  
   - Fine-tune the *best* individual’s policy via actor-critic on the HM-MDP (local gradient) – often yields a few extra bps.  
   - Stress-test on unseen regimes (COVID crash, ’22 inflation, etc.) to check latent-mode generalization.

### 5.  When *not* to bother with HM-MDP

| Situation | Lean full-HMM | Lean vanilla MDP |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Very short-term HFT** where millisecond micro-structure dominates; regimes change too slowly to matter | ✓ |  |
| **Highly engineered state vector** (deep-learning latent embedding already summarizes everything) |  | ✓ |
| **Compute budget is tiny** (e.g., desktop, no GPU/cluster) | ✓ (just regime tag as a feature) | |

In those cases you can still **feed the GA-evolved HMM regime probabilities into a simpler MDP or even heuristic rule-set** – a pragmatic compromise.

## Bottom line

- **HMM alone** is great for *describing* markets but cannot *trade* them.  
- **MDP alone** trades, but assumes the future looks like the past and you see the full state – a bad fit for real markets.  
- **HM-MDP** captures hidden regime shifts *and* lets you optimise actions, so it is the best theoretical core to wrap inside your GA.  
- A GA is valuable because it searches the colossal joint space of (features × model hyper-params × policy) where gradient methods either fail or overfit.

Use an initial HMM for fast regime discovery, then evolve an HM-MDP-aware trading policy; finish with local RL refinements. That workflow exploits the strengths of all three ideas while acknowledging the computational constraints of live futures trading.
